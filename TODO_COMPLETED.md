# COMPLETED: Add Day Names to Sales Report Daily Breakdown

## Changes Made:

1. âœ… Modified `src/components/SalesReport.tsx` to add day name column
   - Added day name column using `new Date(day.date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' })`
   - Updated layout to display: Day Name | Date | Revenue
   - Applied appropriate styling with fixed width for day names and proper spacing

## Technical Details:
- Used JavaScript's built-in Date object to extract day names
- No database changes were made (as requested)
- Only UI/display changes in the React component
- The day names are generated client-side from the existing date data

## Result:
The sales report daily breakdown now shows:
- Day Name (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday")
- Date (formatted as before)
- Revenue amount

This provides better context for users viewing the sales report by showing which day of the week each date corresponds to.
