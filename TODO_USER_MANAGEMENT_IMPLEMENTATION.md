# User Management Implementation Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema
- [x] Created users table with proper structure
- [x] Created user_roles table for role management
- [x] Added foreign key relationships
- [x] Created initial seed data with admin, chef, and dashboard users
- [x] Added comprehensive role definitions (admin, chef, dashboard, inventory_manager, customer)

### 2. API Endpoints
- [x] `/api/users` - GET (list all users)
- [x] `/api/users` - POST (create new user)
- [x] `/api/users/[id]` - PUT (update user)
- [x] `/api/users/[id]` - DELETE (delete user)
- [x] `/api/user-roles` - GET (list all roles)
- [x] `/api/user-roles` - POST (create new role)
- [x] `/api/auth/login` - POST (user authentication)

### 3. Frontend Components
- [x] `UserManagement.tsx` - Complete user management interface
- [x] Integrated with admin panel navigation
- [x] Added to admin page imports and routing

### 4. Authentication System
- [x] Updated login page to use API authentication
- [x] Removed hardcoded credentials
- [x] Added proper error handling
- [x] Enhanced user data storage in localStorage
- [x] Fixed API route format for App Router compatibility

### 5. Additional Features
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Input validation for user operations
- [x] Username uniqueness validation

## üîß Pending Tasks

### 1. Testing
- [ ] Test user creation functionality
- [ ] Test user editing functionality  
- [ ] Test user deletion functionality
- [ ] Test role assignment
- [ ] Test authentication flow

### 2. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement JWT tokens for authentication
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login attempts

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading states for all operations
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for deletions
- [ ] Add success/error notifications
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

### 4. Additional Features
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] User activity logging
- [ ] Role-based access control enhancements

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** - Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
2. **Deploy database changes** - Run the SQL scripts on production database
3. **Test authentication** - Verify login works with new user accounts
4. **Add security measures** - Implement JWT tokens
5. **Add error handling** - Improve user feedback for all operations

## üìã Database Changes Required

Run the following SQL scripts in order:
1. `scripts/init-database.sql` - Creates tables and relationships
2. `scripts/add-user-roles.sql` - Adds comprehensive user roles
3. `scripts/add-existing-users-final.sql` - Adds existing users with hashed passwords
4. `scripts/add-raw-materials-tables.sql` - (If not already run)
5. Manual verification of user data insertion

## üîê Default Admin Credentials

The system includes a default admin user:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Important**: Change the default admin password after first login for security.

## üìù Notes

- The user management system now uses proper database-backed authentication
- All user data is stored in the PostgreSQL database
- Role-based access control is implemented with comprehensive role definitions
- Password security is implemented with bcrypt hashing
- The system is ready for production use after security enhancements
