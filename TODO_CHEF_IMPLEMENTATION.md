- Prepared orders are automatically removed from the chef view
- Clean, minimal interface optimized for kitchen workflow

### API Endpoints:

- **PUT /api/orders/[id]** - Updates order status to 'ready' when marked as prepared

### Navigation:
- Main interface: `/` (customer view)
- Chef interface: `/chef` (kitchen view)
- Added navigation button from main to chef view

## 🚀 Next Steps

   ```

2. **Test the implementation**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` for customer interface
   - Click "Chef View" button or navigate to `http://localhost:3000/chef`
   - Create test orders and verify they appear in chef view
   - Mark orders as prepared and verify they disappear from chef view

3. **Potential enhancements**:
