# TODO: Restore Admin Panel Sales and Revenue Functionality

## ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary of Changes Made:

1. **Added State Variables**: Created state variables for today's sales and total revenue data
2. **Implemented Fetch Functions**: Added functions to fetch data from API endpoints:
   - `fetchTodaysSales()` - fetches today's sales data from `/api/daily-sales/today`
   - `fetchTotalRevenue()` - fetches total revenue data from `/api/total-revenue`
   - `fetchSalesData()` - combines both fetch operations

3. **Added UI Components**: Created two cards to display the metrics:
   - **Today's Sales Card**: Shows total orders and revenue for today with blue theme
   - **Total Revenue Card**: Shows cumulative orders and revenue with green theme

4. **Real-time Updates**: 
   - Added refresh buttons to manually update each metric
   - Automatic loading on component mount
   - Timestamp display for last update

5. **Consistent Design**: 
   - Used existing color scheme (blue for today's sales, green for total revenue)
   - Matched the existing admin panel styling with shadow cards and proper spacing
   - Responsive grid layout

6. **Error Handling**: 
   - Proper error handling for API calls
   - Loading states during data fetching
   - Error messages displayed in the existing error system
