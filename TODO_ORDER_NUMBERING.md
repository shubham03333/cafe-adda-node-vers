# Order Numbering System Implementation

## ✅ Tasks Completed:

1. [x] Updated `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`:
   - Modified POST method to generate order numbers server-side
   - Implemented sequential order numbering starting from 001
   - Ensures new order numbers are always greater than previous ones

2. [x] Updated `src/components/CafeOrderSystem.tsx`:
   - Removed local `orderCounter` state
   - Updated order creation to not send order_number (API generates it)
   - Updated TypeScript types to match new API expectations

3. [x] Updated `src/types/index.ts`:
   - Made `order_number` optional in `CreateOrderRequest` interface
   - Kept `order_number` required in `Order` interface

## Implementation Details:

- ✅ Order numbers are generated server-side to prevent conflicts
- ✅ Sequential numbering starting from 001
- ✅ Thread-safe order number generation
- ✅ Eliminates order number conflicts in multi-user scenarios
- ✅ Centralized order number management
- ✅ More robust and scalable system
- ✅ Maintains sequential order numbering

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Updated to generate order numbers server-side
- ✅ `src/types/index.ts` - Made order_number optional in CreateOrderRequest
- ✅ `src/components/CafeOrderSystem.tsx` - Removed client-side order number generation

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All changes have been successfully implemented. The system now generates order numbers server-side, preventing conflicts when multiple users place orders simultaneously.
