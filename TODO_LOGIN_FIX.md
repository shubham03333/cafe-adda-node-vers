# Login Fix Implementation Plan

## Issues Identified:
1. Password inconsistency between login pages
2. Dashboard authentication expects 'user' role but no login sets this role
3. Dashboard redirects to login instead of providing login form

## Steps to Fix:
- [x] Fix chef password in main login page (changed to chef456)
- [x] Update dashboard authentication to accept multiple roles
- [x] Add login form directly to dashboard page
- [ ] Test login functionality

## Files Modified:
1. src/app/login/page.tsx - Fixed chef password and updated demo credentials
2. src/app/dashbord/page.tsx - Updated authentication to accept admin/chef/user roles and added login form

## Current Status:
- Login credentials are now consistent:
  - Admin: admin / admin123
  - Chef: chef / chef456 (consistent across all login pages)
- Dashboard now accepts admin, chef, and user roles
- Dashboard now has built-in login form so users can log in directly from /dashbord
- Users can enter credentials directly on the dashboard page without being redirected
