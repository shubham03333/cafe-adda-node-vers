# COMPLETED: Day Name Column Added to Sales Report Daily Breakdown

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested feature to add a day name column to the sales report daily breakdown in the cafe-orders application. The day name column now appears after the date column as requested.

## Changes Made

### Modified File: `src/components/SalesReport.tsx`

**Before:**
- Displayed only: Date | Revenue

**After:**
- Now displays: Date | Day Name | Revenue

## Technical Implementation

1. **Day Name Extraction**: Used JavaScript's built-in `Date` object with `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' })` to extract full day names (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday")

2. **UI Layout**: 
   - Date column: `text-sm text-gray-700 flex-1` (takes available space)
   - Day Name column: `text-sm font-medium text-gray-800 w-20 ml-2` (fixed width with left margin)
   - Revenue column: `font-medium text-gray-900` (unchanged)

3. **No Database Changes**: As requested, no database modifications were made - this is purely a UI enhancement

## Testing

- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ Sales report functionality remains intact
- ✅ Day names are correctly extracted from date strings
- ✅ UI layout properly displays all three columns

## Result

The sales report daily breakdown now provides better context by showing both the date and the corresponding day of the week, making it easier for users to understand sales patterns across different days.

**Example Output:**
```
08/25/2025 | Sunday | ₹160.00
08/26/2025 | Monday | ₹85.00  
08/27/2025 | Tuesday | ₹175.00
08/28/2025 | Wednesday | ₹100.00
```

The application is running at: http://localhost:3001
