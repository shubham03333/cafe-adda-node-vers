# Confirmation Dialog Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [ ] Add state variables for confirmation dialog
   - confirmingDeleteOrder: string | null
   - isConfirmModalOpen: boolean

2. [ ] Create confirmation modal component within CafeOrderSystem
   - Modal overlay and container
   - Warning icon and message
   - Cancel and Confirm buttons

3. [ ] Modify delete button behavior
   - Change from direct deleteOrder call to open confirmation modal
   - Pass order ID to confirmation state

4. [ ] Implement confirmation logic
   - Handle confirm: call deleteOrder and close modal
   - Handle cancel: close modal and reset state

5. [ ] Style confirmation modal to match existing design
   - Use red/warning colors for delete confirmation
   - Consistent spacing and typography

6. [ ] Test functionality
   - Verify modal appears correctly
   - Test both confirm and cancel actions
   - Ensure delete operation works after confirmation
