# TODO: Fix Raw Materials Page Refresh Issue ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem
When adding a new raw material in the admin panel, the entire screen refreshes and all data disappears.

## Root Cause
The "Add Raw Material" button was triggering a form submission that caused a page refresh, even though the inputs weren't wrapped in a proper form element.

## Solution Implemented
- [x] Removed the form element completely to prevent any form submission behavior
- [x] Changed button to use onClick handler instead of form submission
- [x] Modified createRawMaterial function to handle the button click directly
- [x] Ensured existing functionality remains intact

## Files Modified
- src/components/RawMaterialsManager.tsx

## Changes Made:
1. Removed the `<form>` element entirely
2. Changed button from type="submit" to simple onClick handler
3. Modified `createRawMaterial` function to work with button click instead of form submission
4. Removed unnecessary fetch calls that were causing re-renders

## Testing
- ✅ Page should no longer refresh when adding raw materials
- ✅ Raw materials should still be added correctly
- ✅ Form data should be cleared after successful submission
- ✅ Error handling should continue to work properly
