# Served Orders Item Name Display Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Resolved
Item names in recent served orders were not displaying fully due to CSS truncation classes.

## Location Fixed
File: `src/components/CafeOrderSystem.tsx`
Section: Served Orders Modal (~lines 1100-1110)

## Changes Made:
**Before:**
```jsx
<span className="truncate max-w-[120px] sm:max-w-[150px]">{item.quantity}x {item.name}</span>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<span className="break-words min-w-0 flex-1">{item.quantity}x {item.name}</span>
<span className="ml-2">₹{item.price * item.quantity}</span>
```

## Solution Details:
- Removed `truncate` class that was adding ellipsis to long text
- Removed `max-w-[120px] sm:max-w-[150px]` width limitations
- Added `break-words` to allow proper word wrapping
- Added `min-w-0 flex-1` for flexible layout
- Added proper spacing with `ml-2` for the price

## Expected Result:
- ✅ Full item names will display without truncation
- ✅ Layout remains clean and readable
- ✅ No ellipsis (...) will appear for long item names
- ✅ Proper spacing between item name and price

## Status: COMPLETED
The fix has been successfully implemented and deployed. Item names will now display fully in served orders statements.
